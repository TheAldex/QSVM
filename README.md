# Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) Real Example
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a supervised learning method used to classify classes in Artificial Intelligence. It has been shown that the use of quantum algorithms in the optimization of kernels used in this method significantly improves the accuracy rate of the machine in performing the prediction.

Therefore, an example of these Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) has been implemented using Python for a real case, using the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset and another slightly simpler case in which the difference between quantum and conventional use can be appreciated in a more clearly way (showing hit rates of both and confusion matrices).

## Libraries Used
- QISKIT Library
- SK Learn Library
- Pandas
- NumPy

## How to Try
If you want to try the implementation you just to type in your console:

```
python py_file.py
```
(or python2, python3 instead)
